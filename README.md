# SecFeed

SecFeed is an RSS or JSON feed that will read the CVE releases and list the most recent issues based on a given list of keywords.

Note that this tool is very loose and does not try to filter a maximum of results, at the contrary, it tries to be light on filtering to give the opportunity to a human (you) to judge if an action has to be taken or not for each item. Therefore you will receive more notifications than there are actions to be taken.

## Parameters
Check in the index.php file, there are some parameters hard coded in there.

```
$keywords = array('drupal', 'wordpress', 'apache', 'php', 'mysql', 'mariadb');
```

Update this list with the keywords of the tech you are looking for.

## Usage
You simply host the site and load the page with two parameters and then subscribe to it in your RSS reader of choice!

*JSON Format, updated every 4 hours*

*RSS Format, updated every 3 hours*

You can use your RSS reader app of choice like [Reeder](http://reederapp.com/) or even an IFTTT recipe like [RSS to Email](https://ifttt.com/recipes/99479-rss-to-email-formatted) to receive email notifications once something comes up.
